My solution to Word Counter problem. All functionality should be implemented and all the tests run :)

To install, clone the repository and install `dotnet`. Tested with version 6.0.101.

You may need `dotnet add package xUnit` for the tests.

To run use `dotnet run files` and to run the tests use `dotnet test`.
